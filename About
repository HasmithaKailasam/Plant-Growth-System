ðŸŒ± Plant Growth Monitoring System
This project simulates a basic Plant Growth Monitoring System using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), LED, 16x2 LCD, and Potentiometer on an Arduino Uno in Tinkercad.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Measures light intensity using an LDR.
Displays real-time light levels on an LCD.
Automatically turns ON an LED if light is below threshold (acts like an artificial grow light).
Adjustable LCD contrast via potentiometer.

ðŸ§° Components Used
Arduino Uno
LDR (Photoresistor)
10kÎ© Resistor (for voltage divider with LDR)
16x2 LCD Display
Potentiometer (to control LCD contrast)
LED (as grow light indicator)
220Î© Resistor (for LED)
Breadboard & Jumper Wires

ðŸ“‹ Working Principle
The LDR and 10kÎ© resistor form a voltage divider connected to analog pin A0.
The analog value changes depending on light falling on the LDR.
If light is below a set threshold (e.g. less than 500), the LED turns ON.
The LCD displays the light intensity in real time.
